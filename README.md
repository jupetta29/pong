# Pong
> Pong is one of the classic and earliest arcade games
 
The game is just a ball that's going across a table and two players each control a paddle and bounce the ball back and forth. 
If you miss a ball, then the other user gains a point.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get Pong up &
running.

```shell
# N/A
```

At this time, there are no modules/packages needed for installation to get started.

## Features

* To prevent the game from being too dull, the ball will speed up each consecutive time it hits a paddle! Hope you have quick fingers!
