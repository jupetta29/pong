# Pong
> This project is a recreation of the best game from the classic Nokia 3310

Pong is a classic arcade game that has a really simple premise. 
The game is just a ball that's going across a table and two players each control a paddle and bounce the ball back and forth. 
If you miss a ball, then the other user gains a point.

## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get Pong up &
running.

```shell
# N/A
```

At this time, there are no modules/packages needed for installation to get started.
